It is a basic Github App implementation (list of repositories of the organisation) where the main goal to achieve was usage of functional components with React Native Navigation (so no more ~~`class MyComponent extends React.Component { ... }`~~, only functions with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) .

Some stuff used:
- [React Native Navigation v4](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) - truly native navigation experience for iOS and Android
- [React Native Navigation Hooks](https://github.com/underscopeio/react-native-navigation-hooks) - a set of React hooks for React Native Navigation
- [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - customizable icons for React Native
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) - native touches and gesture system for React Native
- [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) - just in case, we will need it one time anyways
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - strict syntactical superset of JavaScript
